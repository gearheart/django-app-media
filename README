This application provides management command to link
application-specific media files to project media directory:
    $ ./manage.py link_app_media

For every application in settings.INSTALLED_APPS it will look for source
directory and if there is 'media' directory it will be symlinked to
    MEDIA_ROOT/apps/%(app_name)s

If application's media directory is called static or other, you can set it:
    APP_MEDIA_PREFIXES = {
        'app_name': 'static',
    }

Also you can set destination directory:
    APP_MEDIA_ROOT = MEDIA_ROOT
